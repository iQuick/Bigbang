        Because we do not have system privileges, so only through other means to provide you with a more convenient word segmentation experience, shortcomings, please understand. \n\t\t\t\t
        In addition to the suggested usage recommendations, we have the following suggestions: \n\t\t\t\t
        1. In the WeChat, QQ and other chat applications, the use of click to trigger the trigger is more convenient, as is the click, double-click or long press, it is their advantages and disadvantages, by your own judgment. \n\t\t\t\t
        2. In the browsing application, the use of replication trigger segmentation, for some browsers may have to exit the interface to trigger word segmentation, multi-step operation, it is still very convenient. \n\t\t\t\t
        3. The ability to use global replication where global replication, than the system to facilitate replication, but where can we have to try your own, and we can not count all applications. \n\t\t\t\t
        4. In other functions are not useful when the screenshot OCR as a last weapon, but also can play a lot of role, but if the text is not clear and complete, the recognition rate may need to be improved. \n\t\t\t\t
        5. You can also open the "click the ball trigger Bigbang" to reduce false triggering. \n\t\t\t\t
        \n\n\t\t\t\t
        Of course, you will have their own experience in the use of the process, we provide the greatest space,
        You can customize your own features and segmentation interface. If there are other custom needs, you can contact us, for good advice, we have never been good! \n\t\t\t\t

    <string name="about_control">Why use a floating window or a notification bar</string>
    <string name="about_control_msg">\t\t\t\tThe function of this application is relatively complex, requires the user to have some hands-on exploration capabilities. Suspended window, notification bar and long key menu, on the one hand can provide monitoring function of the switch to prevent false triggering, on the other hand is the global copy and screenshot OCR function entrance. It is recommended that you choose the most comfortable way to use. \n\t\t\t\t
         If you do not like, do not need to use global replication and screenshots OCR, you can also choose to open the "Click the ball trigger Bigbang", so that when monitoring clicks and replication, and will not trigger the wrong word, affecting the user experience. \n\t\t\t\t
         PS: In some mobile phones, open the suspension window will result in the application to apply for permission to fail, you can install a new application to close the suspension window, you can also use the notification bar instead.</string>


    <string name="about_accessibility">Permissions on Accessibility service</string>
    <string name="about_accessibility_msg">The application can trigger a click by monitoring the click, but the permissions need to be granted to the secondary mode, but the secondary schema privilege may be reclaimed by the system after the process is cleaned up, so add this application to the autostart white. List and clean up the white list.</string>

    <string name="about_click">Why sometimes clicking a trigger participle does not work</string>
    <string name="about_click_msg"> \t\t\t\t because we are monitoring the user\'s click to determine whether to trigger the word segmentation, this part of the function is achieved through the auxiliary service. A click can not be detected when: \n\t\t\t\t
1. Some applications do not support ancillary services on the click of the capture, after the occurrence of clicks, no notice to the ancillary services, such as WeChat circle of friends. \n\t\t\t\t
2. Some applications shielding some of the click events, such as setting some location is not clickable, such as the system settings page can not use long press trigger segmentation. \n\t\t\t\t
3. Some seem to be the text of the place, in fact, use the picture to draw, such as some readers: iReader and so on. \n\t\t\t\t
And sometimes some applications will abuse the click event, such as NetEase cloud music comment interface, will slip mistaken for long press. \n\t\t\t\t
If this happens, you can try to use a copy trigger, global copy, or screenshot OCR to trigger the word segmentation.</string>

    <string name="how_to_use_copy">Why some browsers do not trigger word segmentation in replication</string>
    <string name="how_to_use_copy_msg"> \t\t\t\t In some browsers (such as WeChat comes with a browser, QQ browser, UC browser, etc.), copy text can not trigger the word segmentation. \n\t\t\t\t
        This is because these browsers take over the system\'s copy function, the user clicks the copy, to exit the browser page when it is really set to the system\'s clipboard, so we will be able to receive notification, and then only Trigger segmentation. \n\t\t\t\t
        The solution is, in these browsers, the copy is complete, the temporary exit the browser page (Home key back to the desktop, or enter the multi-tasking interface, or press the Back key to completely exit), you can trigger the word break. Or use our provided screenshots OCR recognition, global replication (only in the Chrome kernel browser to be useful).</string>

1. If the application does not provide text information to the auxiliary service, you can not fetch the text, such as browser (Chrome browser exception) and QQ message interface, etc. At this time you can consider using normal replication. \n\t\t\t\t
2. Some seemingly text content, in fact, as the picture is drawn, it can not grasp the text information, such as the hammer desktop, iReader, this time you can use the screenshot OCR function.</string>

    <string name="about_xposed"> The Xposed version of a variety of trigger mode settings</string>
    <string name="about_xposed_msg">\t\t\t\tXP version with the general version of the same, providing a single-click, double-click, long press, three kinds of trigger.\n\t\t\t\t
The trigger principle is when you click to click to the text, so some non-clickable area can also be triggered, such as the upper left corner of the QQ back. Some of the click area, if you click on the text, is also able to separate out these words.\n\t\t\t\t
But if the use of single-click trigger, there may be some false touch, of course, with the "click on the ball trigger" will be better, so in the end how to set, or see you use habits.\n\t\t\t\t
Known bugs：\n\t\t\t\t
1. In qq, if the trigger with a long press, with the default long press a little conflict, resulting in long press the menu display does not come out,\n\t\t\t\t
2. qq space can not be triggered,\n\t\t\t\t
3. Universal copy is still relying on ancillary services to do.\n\t\t\t\t
This is still not perfect, if you have feedback on the use of the problem.\n\t\t\t\t
PS: xposed trigger mode and the general version is not the same, each have advantages and disadvantages, we will try to optimize.</string>
